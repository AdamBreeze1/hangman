## Description
The Hangman Game is a simple word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word one letter at a time. This project implements the basic functionality for word selection and user input validation.

### Aim
The aim of this project is to provide a basic hangman game foundation where players can guess words and learn the logic of the game. It's a simple implementation for educational purposes.

### What I Learned
- Random word selection from a list.
- Input validation for single letters.
- Basic Python scripting.

## Installation
